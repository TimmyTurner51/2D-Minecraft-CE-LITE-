Added features and improvements:

- Languages! We have English and Dutch thus far (dutch provided by Swordgirl)
- Settings page revamp!
- More World Generation Options screen, which lets you toggle flowers, villages, etc.
- Settings save and load.
- Sprites now load in their own array, so the game loads from those rather than individual sprite data from the appvars.
- Graphics for resource loading. This is based on official Minecraft resource loading screen.
- Village houses!

Known bugs:
- Village Generation can be a bit...broken. I'm working on fixing it asap.
- FPS counter may not be 100% accurate. Using the barebones method, it only gave 1 FPS, even though the game wasn't that slow. So I'm reworking it to take into account the render speed, game speed, etc.
- When loading a previous world, and exit, the saving/compression routine can be way too slow, freeze (requiring RAM reset), or even crash the calc completely (more rare).
- When loading a previous world, the gamemode resets to survival when it was originally creative.

Future Updates (in order of timeline):
 - Finish Village Generation
 - World Seed implementation
 - Finish gamemodes
 - Dimensions


Thanks for testing! This will be updated frequently!
